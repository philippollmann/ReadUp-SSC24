# ReadUp (Swift Student Challenge 24)
##### Description
ReadUp is a reading coach, supporting and motivating children in their reading learning process. According to the New York Times, 1/3 of children in America have inadequate reading skills and 60% of children in Boston are at high risk for reading problems. On the one hand, the pandemic has contributed to this problem, as children have received fewer guided reading. They also spend more time watching TV than reading. According to the article, children who can't read by the end of elementary school are more likely to drop out of school, earn less money as adults and become involved in the criminal justice system.

ReadUp uses the Apple speech framework to listen and track children as they read aloud. When kids get stuck on a word, TextToSpeech is used to read the words to them. In between pages, children have to solve quizzes and AR challenges to keep them interested in reading and check their reading comprehension. The AR challenges were created using ARKit and RealityKit. To ensure extensibility, the books, quizzes and challenges are defined in JSON and can be easily extended. The story was written by me and the sounds were also composed by me using Logic Pro.
